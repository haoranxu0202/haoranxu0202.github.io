I am currently pursuing my [Master of Financial Engineering](https://www.orie.cornell.edu/orie/cfem) at Cornell University. Before joining Cornell, I obtained a Bachelor of Science with Honours in Statistics from the University of Nottingham, where I received First Class Honors and was the recipient of Dean's Scholarships.

I possess a solid academic foundation in areas including optimization, time series analysis, statistical inference, applied statistical modeling, and machine learning. My technical proficiency extends to Python, R, SQL, MATLAB, Excel VBA, and LaTeX/Markdown. 

Throughout my academic journey, I have accumulated valuable experience in quantitative finance through internships at various companies. I am currently engaged as a Quantitative Research Intern at Trendalyze Inc. for summer 2023. I have also participated in several research projects, such as the "Stability Measure for MVPs leveraging Marchenko-Pastur Theory & Eigenvalue Distributions”, “Advanced Machine Learning Applications in Image and Text Classification”, “Improving Portfolio Selection Using Option-Implied Volatility and Turnover Constraint” at Cornell University and the “Minimum Edge Compression of General Graphs (Allow Overlapping Nodes)" at the University of Nottingham. 

My interest is focused on developing innovative algorithms and practical solutions for challenges in financial engineering and data analysis. Outside of my academic and professional pursuits, I enjoy LEGO building, body building, calligraphy. I am passionate about learning and exploring new ideas, both in the realm of finance and beyond.
